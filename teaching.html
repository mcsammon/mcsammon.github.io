<b>Finance I (for Full-Time Kellogg MBA Students)</b> <br>

As part of my PhD program, I run a set of nine review sessions for Finance I each quarter.  For each review session, I've created a power point with practice questions, and an Excel worksheet.  In some of the Excel spreadsheets, there are two tabs for each question -- a blank template, and the complete solution.  The blank worksheet is designed to replicate the template a student would recieve on a midterm or final exam. <br>

<b>Managerial Finance (for Kellogg EMBA Students)</b> <br>

For each review session, I've created a power point with practice questions, and an Excel worksheet.  For each question, there are two tabs on the Excel worksheet -- a blank template, and the complete solution.  The blank worksheet is designed to replicate the template a student would recieve on a midterm or final exam. I suggest attempting to fill in blank template before consulting the solutions.<br>

<b>Text Analysis in Python (University of Chicago) </b> <br>

I was invited to teach a guest lecture to Economics PhD students at University of Chicago.  The lecture was part of a class on using text as data.  The lecture was on using Python to analyze large text datasets, with a focus on processing SEC filings. <a href="/images/python_text_analysis.pdf" target="_blank"> Slides</a>, <a href="/images/examplecode.7z" target="_blank"> Zip File with Sample Programs </a>  <br>

For class members just getting started with Python, I recommended installing Anaconda (a distribution of Python designed for data analysis) and PyCharm (an IDE).  You can find my setup instructions <a href="/images/installing_python.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a>.<br>
