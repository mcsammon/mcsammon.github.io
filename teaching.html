Finance I (MBA)

Managerial Finance (EMBA)

Guest Teaching:

I taught a guest lecture to PhD students at University of Chicago on using Python to analyze large text datasets, with a focus on SEC filings. The slides are <a href="/images/python_text_analysis.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a>.  

You can find a zip archive with all the sample programs in the slides <a href="/images/examplecode.7z" target="_blank"> here</a>.

If you are just getting started with Python, I reccomend installing Anaconda and PyCharm.  You can find my setup instructions <a href="/images/installing_python.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a>.
