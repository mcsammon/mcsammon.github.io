# Finance I (MBA)

I teach nine TA sessions for Finance I.  For each review session, I've uploaded a power point with practice questions, and an Excel worksheet.  For each question, there are two tabs on the Excel worksheet -- a blank template, and the complete solution.  The blank worksheet is designed to replicate the template you would recieve on a midterm or final exam. I suggest attempting to fill in blank template before consulting the solutions. <br>

Session 2: <br>

Session 3: <br>

Session 4: Midterm Review <br>

Session 5: <br>

Session 6: <br>

# Guest Teaching:

I taught a guest lecture to PhD students at University of Chicago on using Python to analyze large text datasets, with a focus on SEC filings. The slides are <a href="/images/python_text_analysis.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a>.   <br>

You can find a zip archive with all the sample programs in the slides <a href="/images/examplecode.7z" target="_blank"> here</a>. <br>

If you are just getting started with Python, I reccomend installing Anaconda and PyCharm.  You can find my setup instructions <a href="/images/installing_python.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a>.<br>
