Iâ€™m a Senior Research Assistant working at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in
the Supervision Regulation and Credit Department.  

At the Federal Reserve, I am working on several research projects, including the impact of Dodd-Frank stress tests on bank behavior, developing a new asset-pricing factor based on sensitivity to monetary policy shocks and the momentum effect in equity portfolios.

I attended Tufts University, and graduated in 2013 with a degree in Quantitative
Economics.  From January 2014-December 2014, I attended classes part-time at
Harvard University.

I will begin a PhD program in finance at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management this fall.

A refined version of my Senior Honors Thesis was published in the North American
Journal of Economics and Finance in January 2015 (with Marcelo Bianconi and
Scott MacLachlan). In my spare time, I enjoy running along the Charles.

Recently, I have been working on a new research project with Marcelo Bianconi, which attempts to better understand the information contained in the relative price of index put options.
