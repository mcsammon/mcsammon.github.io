I'm a fifth-year PhD candidate at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management studying Finance.  My most recent paper, showing that passive management (i.e. index funds and ETFs) reduce market efficiency can be found on the [research](http://marcosammon.com/research/) page.

From 2013 to 2015, I worked as a Senior Research Assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in the Supervision Regulation and Credit Department.

I attended Tufts University, and graduated in 2013 with a degree in Quantitative Economics.
