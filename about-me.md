I'm a PhD student at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management studying Finance.  I just completed my first year, and I finally have a chance to apply what I learned to new research projects.

From 2013 to 2015, I worked as a Senior Research Assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in the Supervision Regulation and Credit Department.  

At the Federal Reserve, I worked on several research projects, including measuring the impact of consumption growth on dividend growth in momentum, book-to-market and size portfolio, understanding the sensitivity of stock returns to monetary policy in the cross-section and examining the effects of the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests.

I attended Tufts University, and graduated in 2013 with a degree in Quantitative Economics.  From January 2014-December 2014, I attended classes part-time at Harvard University.  On my own, I completed John Cochrane's Asset Pricing course through Coursera.

A refined version of my Senior Honors Thesis was published in the North American
Journal of Economics and Finance in January 2015 (with Marcelo Bianconi and
Scott MacLachlan). In my spare time, I enjoy running along Lake Michigan.
