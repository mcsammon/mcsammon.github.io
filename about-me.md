I'm a PhD student at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management studying Finance.  I just completed my first year, and I finally have a chance to apply what I learned to new research projects.

From 2013 to 2015, I worked as a Senior Research Assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in the Supervision Regulation and Credit Department.

I attended Tufts University, and graduated in 2013 with a degree in Quantitative Economics.

A refined version of my Senior Honors Thesis was published in the North American
Journal of Economics and Finance in January 2015 (with Marcelo Bianconi and
Scott MacLachlan). In my spare time, I enjoy running along Lake Michigan.
