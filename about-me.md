I’m a Senior Research Assistant working at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in
the Supervision Regulation and Credit Department.  

At the Federal Reserve, I am working on several research projects, including the
sensitivity of stock returns to monetary policy in the
cross-section and examining the effects of the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests.

I attended Tufts University, and graduated in 2013 with a degree in Quantitative
Economics.  From January 2014-December 2014, I attended classes part-time at
Harvard University. I am currently enrolled in John Cochrane’s Asset Pricing
Part I class through Coursera.

A refined version of my Senior Honors Thesis was published in the North American
Journal of Economics and Finance in January 2015 (with Marcelo Bianconi and
Scott MacLachlan). In my spare time, I enjoy running along the Charles.
