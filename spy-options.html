<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Relative put price data will be stale on trading holidays.  In addition, data collected on the third Friday of any month will use the last price, instead of the bid-ask midpoint.</p>
<p>Calculation takes the average relative price if multiple options are tied.</p>
<p>The same option is never used for multiple calculations on the same day (ties are broken arbitrarily).</p>
