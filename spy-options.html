Let \(p_t^o\) denote the opening price at time \(t\), and \(p_t^c\) the closing price at time \(t\) <br />

The return in a 5-min bar is the (close price-open price)/open price.  For example,
the first return in a given day is \((p_{9:35}^{c}-p_{9:30}^{o})/p_{9:30}^{o}\)  <br />

Daily return is the \((p_{4:00 PM}^{c}-p_{9:30 AM}^{o})/p_{9:30 AM}^{o}\)  <br />
Volatility-Adjusted Return is Daily Return/\(\sqrt{\text{Sum of Squared 5-min. Returns}}\) <br />
