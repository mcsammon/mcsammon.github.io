As a Senior Research Assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, I work with a group of economists focused on empirical finance.

My research interests include a variety of finance topics including bank regulation, stock returns and derivatives pricing.

I am especially interested in equity options, which motivated me to create the graph below.  It’s not surprising that during times of distress  the cost of “insurance” goes up.  I prefer this presentation of the data, however, because it shows the relative impact of different financial crises over the past 20+ years.
