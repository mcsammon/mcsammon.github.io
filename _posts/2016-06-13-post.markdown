title:  "Motivation: Relative Price of Put Options"
---
It’s not surprising that during times of distress  the cost of “insurance” (as measured by at-the-money put options) goes up.  I prefer this presentation of the data, however, because it shows the relative impact of different financial crises over the past 20+ years.  Note, this graph was created using SPX options, which are based on the underlying basket of securities.  This is different from SPY options which are based on an ETF that tracks the S&P 500.
