title:  "Who Owns Passive Ownership?"
---

I have been updating <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3571409" title="b1">my paper on the introduction of ETFs</a> to incorporate comments from my recent Kellogg bag lunch <a href="/Post_Images/6_19_2020/slides.pdf" target="_blank"> (a copy of the presentation can be found here)</a>. In the paper, I develop a model where rational agents decide to allocate attention to a systematic risk that affects all assets, or idiosyncratic risks that are specific to only one asset.  

The systematic risk-factor, however, is less volitile than the stock-specific factors.  This leads to the key trade-off in the model. Agents want to balance: (1) making more profits and (2) avoid holding too risky of a portfolio.  This trade-off is goverend by risk aversion.  If agents are risk averse, they prefer to hold diversified portfolios which are not very risky.  If agents are not risk averse, they prefer to make targed bets on stock-specific risks.  

In trying to link the effects of introducing ETFs on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243910" title="b1">my paper on passive ownership</a>, it got me thinking.  What is passive ownership in the model?  This got me thinking -- who owns ETFs in the data?  In this post, I am going to look at data on insutitional investors.

# Defining Passive Ownership


Lets start with <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040315/what-difference-between-passive-and-active-portfolio-management.asp" title="b1">this definition from Investopedia</a>.  They say:
Active portfolio management focuses on outperforming the market in comparison to a specific benchmark such as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.
Passive portfolio management mimics the investment holdings of a particular index in order to achieve similar results.

But does this make sense? What if someone who wants to outperform the market has some market-timing strategy.  They may buy an ETF on the S&S&P 500 when they think the market is going to go up, and short the same ETF (or just stay out of it) when they think the market is going to go down.

# Holdings of Instutitional Investors

I wanted to construct three measures of who owns ETFs:
1) What percent of each group's total long equity positions in 13Fs is ETFs
2) Total dollar holdings of ETFs
3) Percent of total ETF AUM owned by these groups

I did this based on Professor Bushee's data
<a href="http://acct.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/bushee/IIclass.html" title="b1">availalle here</a>

The first breakdown is by type of instutitional investor:

I then do a breakdown by whether or not they are 'tax sensitive':

ETFs have many tax advantages relative to index mutual funds
<a href="https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/benefits-of-etfs#:~:text=Tax%20benefits,-ETFs%20have%202&text=Due%20to%20structural%20differences%2C%20mutual,the%20life%20of%20the%20investment" title="b1">(see this explanation by Fidelity)</a> so its not surprising that tax sensitive instutitions have them as a large rpart of their portiolio.

# Who Holds the Rest?

Noticed that the shares added up to more than 1.

Here is a table from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CGEKOLM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1" title="b1">The Instutitional ETF Toolbox</a> (a great book if you want to get started in learning about ETFs).  This table, which is based on data from Goldman Sachs, shows the long and short positions of Hedge Funds in ETFs.

Note that hedge funds are net short almost all these ETFs!  This means that the total dollars of hedge funds short positions in these funds is larger than their total long positions.  

This can also explain how there are more dollars in 13F longs in ETFs than there are in Total Net Assets (TNA).  If hedge funds are heavily shorting ETFs, they are effectively taking the opposite side of these long positions. If I borrow a share of SPY from you, and sell it to someone else, you still have your long position on your book, and now the person I sold it to also has the long position on their book.  

If we check out some data from <a href="https://www.etf.com/sections/features-and-news/most-shorted-etfs
" title="b1">ETF.com</a> we can see that some of these short positions are massive.  At the time of writing, over 500% of the retail sector ETF (XRT) was short.
