title:  "The Effect of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act on the Stock Market"
---

Over the past few weeks, I have been reading <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Big-Debt-Crises-Ray-Dalio-ebook/dp/B07GLBHM48/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=debt+crises+dalio&qid=1596130405&sr=8-2" title="b1">Big Debt Crises</a> by Ray Dalio.  The case study on the Great Depression ties nicely into two projects I'm working on (1) My paper, "What Triggers National Stock Market Jumps?" with Scott Baker, Nick Bloom and Steve Davis, which uses newspaper accounts to identify the causes of large moves in the stock market and (2) my paper on
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3340700" title="b1">Trade Policy Uncertainty</a>.  

In Dalio's book, he claims, "Stocks sold off sharply as it became clear the tariff bill [Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act] would pass. After falling 5 percent the previous week, the Dow dropped another 7.9 percent on June 16, the day before the tariff bill passed".  I noticed that in our Wall Street Journal (WSJ) dataset (available at <a href="https://stockmarketjumps.com/" title="b1">https://stockmarketjumps.com/</a>), we did not attribute this market drop to trade policy.  I wanted to understand why the WSJ didn't make the connection between the tariffs and the stock market, so I decided to gather more newspaper articles. 

For the most part, I am going to take a step back, and let the journalists of 90 years ago speak.  Their commentary is not contaminated by years of hindsight, as Dalio's book might be (although each case study in the book does have a 'real time' news feed, so the reader can see what journalists at the time were thinking as the crises evolved).  Every article in this post is a primary source from the ProQuest Historical Newspaper database.  All the articles are from 6/17/1930 -- the first day after the tariff was passed in the Senate -- and are analyzing what happened on 6/16/1930.  They are not in an easily machine-readable format, so I have included pictures of the articles in this post.

# Historical Context

According to Dalio: "Protectionist sentiment resulted most notably in the passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (*Also known as The Tariff Act of 1930*), which imposed tariffs on nearly 20,000 US imports. Investors and economists alike feared that the proposed 20 percent increase in tariffs would trigger a global trade war and cripple an already weak global economy."

This figure (also from Dalio's book) plots the average tariff rate on imports which were taxed:

Not all sectors, however, were going to be equally affect by these tariffs.  The plot below shows the distribution of new tariff rates by industry:

This heterogeneity is going to be important later in the post.

# Wall Street Journal

On 6/16/1930, the CRSP value-weighted index, which is what we use to identify large moves in the stock market, was down 5.4%.


We coded this day as commodities based on the following WSJ articles.  The first article mentions the tariffs, but said the main factor was the drop in commodity prices.

I believe the drop in commodities was related to the tariffs, but let's wait for that.

This article makes no mention of the tariff, and only attributed the move to commodities prices:

In fact, some WSJ articles argue that the tariffs will help the U.S. economy:

This wasn't the only article touting the benefits of the tariff, even though the market was down over 5!

Journalists at the time thought that the passage of the bill resolved uncertainty:
![fig](/Post_Images/7_31_2020/wsj2.PNG)

And they thought it would stimulate trade.

With hindsight, we know otherwise.  According to Dalio: "As similar policies piled up in the years that followed, they accelerated the collapse in global trade caused by the economic contraction."  During the Great Depression, US imports and exports dropped by 67% (Eckes, 1995).

Not every article in the WSJ was as positive on the tariffs.  This article has some strong words to describe the tariff plan.  At the time, Hoover thought the tariffs were not perfect, but he would have the power to ammend them as needed:

Here is another passage from the same article, where  they discuss the President's plans to change the tariffs:

A concern at the time was that our trading partners would levy retaliatory tariffs:

Although they thought it would have no effect on the price of copper:

# New York Times

The articles in Dalio's time line come from the New York Times (NYT), so I decided to look there next.

This article blames the tariff bill for the drop in the stock market.

Although not every article in the NYT agrees on the cause.

Smoot was very positive on the tariffs:
![fig](/Post_Images/7_31_2020/smoot.PNG)

Although he might have been missing a few facts.   In this passage, he is claiming the stock market is up in response to the tariffs, even though we know it was down:
![fig](/Post_Images/7_31_2020/facts.PNG)

Finally, this NYT article links the commodities drop to the tariffs:

# Other Newspapers

What did other newspapers have to say?  The Washington Post attributes the drop to the tariffs:
![fig](/Post_Images/7_31_2020/wp.PNG)

As does the Chicago Tribune:
![fig](/Post_Images/7_31_2020/ct.PNG)

The Los Angeles Times, however, attributes it to commodities:
![fig](/Post_Images/7_31_2020/lat.PNG)
The last paragraph says the tariff measure was an 'aggravating factor', but does not make a strong link to the stock market's performance that day.

# Trade Policy Uncertainty and Stock Returns

How does all this link to my paper on Trade Policy Uncertainty?  We find that the introduction of uncertainty...
![fig](/Post_Images/7_31_2020/fig2.PNG)

Was there uncertainty in this case?
From NYT:

Also from the NYT:

# What (Actually) Happened?

A lot of people ask about the big jumps project, why not just code what 'actually' happened.  I think these newspaper articles show that people at the time may not have known.

I think the strongest link, however, is the timing of the drop:

So what happed to stock returns:

How did this relate to tariffs:
