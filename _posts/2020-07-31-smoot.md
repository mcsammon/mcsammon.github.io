title:  "Effect of Smoot Hawley Tariffs on the Stock Market"
---

I have been reading <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Big-Debt-Crises-Ray-Dalio-ebook/dp/B07GLBHM48/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=debt+crises+dalio&qid=1596130405&sr=8-2" title="b1">Big Debt Crises</a> by Ray Dalio.

The chapter on the great depression ties into two projects I'm working on (1)
<a href="https://stockmarketjumps.com/" title="b1">https://stockmarketjumps.com/</a> and (2)
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3340700" title="b1">Trade</a>

For the most part, I am going to take a step back, and let the journalists of 90 years ago speak.  Their analysis is not contaminated by all our years of hindsight.  Every article in this post is a primary source from the ProQuest Historical Newspaper database.  All the articles are from 6/17/1930 -- the first day after the tariff passed -- and are analyzing what happened on 6/16/1930.

# Big Debt Crises

Stocks sold off sharply as it became clear the tariff bill would pass. After falling 5 percent the previous week, the Dow dropped another 7.9 percent on June 16, the day before the tariff bill passed.

6/16/1930: Mkt down 5.4%


# Wall Street Journal

We coded this day as commodities:

Not just one article that attributed the move to commodoties, but several:

WSJ seems positive on the tariff:

Another article touts that the tariff will help, even though the market was down over 5!

They thought it would resolve uncertainty:

The thought it would stimulate trade (with hindsight, we know otherwise)

As similar policies piled up in the years that followed, they accelerated the collapse in global trade caused by the economic contraction.

This is inconsistent with other things in the paper.  Strong words by the WSJ about the tariff

They know this lead to retaliatory tariffs:

Although they thought it would have no effect on Copper

# New York Times

Primary article looks to blame the tariff bill for the drop in the stock market.

Although articles differ

Smoot was very positive on the tariffs

Seems like he might not have had all the facts

The NYT links the commodities drop to the tariffs

# Trade Policy Uncertainty and Stock Returns

We find that the introduction of uncertainty...

Was there uncertainty in this case?

# What (Actually) Happened?

A lot of people ask about the big jumps project, why not just code what 'actually' happened.  I think these newspaper articles show that people at the time may not have known.

I think the strongest link, however, is the timing of the drop:

So what happed to stock returns:

How did this relate to tariffs:
