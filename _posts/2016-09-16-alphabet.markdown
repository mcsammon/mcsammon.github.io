title:  "What's in a Name?"
---

Given the success of companies like Apple, Amazon and American Express, I was curious if a company's name could predict its return.  It would be worrying if this worked, as there is no fundamental reason why companies starting with A-E should outperform companies starting with, say,  F-J.  Stories like stock screens returning results alphabetically or investors having an aversion to certain letters seem too far-fetched.  I sort into portfolios based on the first letter of a company's name to check this result.

# Methodology

I get monthly stock data from 1980-2015 in CRSP, and restrict to ordinary common shares traded on major exchanges.  At the end of every month, I extract the first character of a company's name and give it a numerical value between 1 and 35: <br />
Example 1: First character of 1-800 Flowers is, "1" and it is given a value of 1 (there are no names starting with 0) <br />
Example 2:  First character of Apple is "A" and it is given a value of 10 <br />
Example 3: First character of Zing Technologies is "Z" and it is given a value of 35 <br />
I then sort into 10 value-weighted portfolios based on deciles of this number (i.e. the bottom 10% of values are in portfolio 1, etc.).  This allows the letter breakpoints to change slightly over time with changes in the frequency of first letters.  Because this is a discrete measure, even within a month, portfolios don't necessarily have the same number of securities.  I tried making the portfolios contain the same number of securities and the results were similar.  <br />
In addition, I create an "HML" style factor factor, which is the return on portfolio 10 minus the return on portfolio 1 (reading it again, maybe ZMA - for Z minus A - would have been a better name). <br />
I also tried sorting into 6 value-weighted portfolios based on the first letter themselves: Companies starting with 1-9 are in portfolio 1 (although there are no companies like this before 1983), A-E are in portfolio 2, F-J are in portfolio 3, K-O are in portfolio 4, P-T are in portfolio 5, and U-Z are in portfolio 6.  I construct another HML style factor, except this time it is portfolio 6 minus portfolio 2, because portfolio 1 is sparsely populated.  Again, the portfolios will not have the same number of firms, as some first letters are more popular than others.

# Empirical Results

The table below shows the annualized (multiplied by 12) average returns, annualized (multiplied by $$\sqrt{12}$$) standard deviation and annualized Sharpe ratio: <br />

There is little difference in average returns across portfolios and sorting methodologies - they all pretty much track the market.  The HML factors have an insignificant alpha once you control for market exposure. <br />
For robustness, I calculated the same statistics using only data from 2000 to 2015:

Post 2000, with the decile portfolios, the firms in portfolio 1 returned on average 2.3% more than firms in portfolio 10, and given this is based on deciles, it is not caused by portfolio 1 being sparsely populated.  A t-test shows this difference is marginally statistically significant with $$p=0.08$$.  I thought it was being driven by a size effect (small companies names start with a number), so I repeated the exercise for the largest 500 firms and the effect goes away.  Even before excluding small firms the alpha was insignificant once controlling for market, SMB and HML exposure. <br />
For the 6-portfolio sort, you can see they pretty much track the market (except portfolio 1, which as mentioned above, is sparsely populated): <br />

# Conclusion

When searching for new asset pricing factors, it is important to avoid data-snooping.  Requiring a good theoretical reason why your sorting technique will generate spreads in expected returns can prevent data mining (ex. sorting on past returns because of persistence in profitability - see Novy-Marx 2015).  Here, I sorted on something that shouldn't predict returns - and it didn't - but I'm sure if I tried 20 more random sorts, one of them would create a new (totally spurious) factor.  At least for now, alphabet risk is priced!
