title:  "Text Analysis in Python"
---

Over the past few years, there has been a boom in the number of papers utilizing text as data.

For example, a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA11182/abstract">
   recent paper
  </a> by Koijen, Philipson and Uhlig uses SEC filings to measure healthcare firms' exposure to regulation risk. 

I taught a guest lecture last month on using Python to analyze large text datasets, with a focus on SEC filings. The slides are posted below, and I hope they are useful for people just getting into the subject.
