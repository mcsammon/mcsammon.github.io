title:  "Are Momentum Funds Mometum Funds?"
---

Some stock characteristics have been able to predict the expected returns of stocks.  One of these characteristis is past returns.  Many papers (e.g. Jegadeesh Titman 1993) have shown momentum -- stocks that went up keep going up, while stocks that went down keep going down.  This means it should be profitable to buy 'winners' (stocks that went up), and sell 'losers' (stocks that went down).  In practice, however, this strategy requires a lot of trading, which may be difficult for the average investor.  

As an alterantive, some companies have started selling momentum funds: you pay them a management fee, and they execute momentum though.  Before investing in one of these funds, however, you would want to know how close the momentum you're buying is to the momentum in academic research.  

In this blog post, I will review a basic momentum strategy, examine the growth of momentum mutual funds, and look at how close these mutual funds are to the momentum strategy.

# Review of Momentum

There are many ways to trade on momentum, but one way is to look at firms returns from months t-12 to t-2 -- note you are excluding the last month's return at t-1.  Then, sort firms into 10 groups based on their returns over this period.  You then long the firms that went up the most, and short the firms that went down the most.

This strategy has historically performed well.  Here is a plot of the value of $1 invested in this strategy in 1930:

If it wasn't for the momentum 'crash' after the financial crisis, momentum would seem insane.  This is a reminder that even though momentum had higher returns, and a higher sharpe ratio than the market when many of the famous momentum papers were written, it is not without huge risk.  The momentum strategy lost more than half its value in the span of a few months. 

Here is a plot since the 1980's

So momentum did very well up until around the 2000's.  Then it experienced some volatility and a big crash.  After 2010, it did worse than the market, although recently it has been performing similarly to the market. 

Given momentum's poor recent performance, it is surprising that momentum funds have grown so substantially over the past 20 years, as I will show in the next subsection

# Momentum Mutual Funds

The mutual fund/ETF industry has grown massively over the past 20 years.  Below, I plot the TNA (total net assets) in billions of all mutual funds.  Note that this includes mutual funds that do not hold stocks, which is why it seems large relative to the whole value of the stock market.

I identify momentum funds as funds with momentum in the name, which hold at least 50% of their assets in equities. Number of momentum funds ha sgrown

And the size of these funds is now near $25 Billion

As I said, momentum requires a lot of trading, so I wanted to know what fees look like.  Here are the average fees of mutual funds with at least 50% of their assets in equities.

Momentum fund fees look similar -- but these are high relative to 0.095% for SPY, which has outlasted and outperformed all these momentum funds

Here is a list of the biggest momentum funds as of 2019:

There is a lot of concentration in this industry, with more than 10% of all momentum fund assets in the largest fund. 

# Are Momentum Funds Mometum Funds?

The most accurate way to tell if these funds are implementing the momentum strategy i outlined above is to look at their holdings and see if they differ from the holdings predicted by the strategy.  For simplicity, I just look at the correlation between the daily returns of the momentum strategy and the daily returns of the funds.

Here are some histograms looking at the correlation overall, and by year.

Note that for the whole sample, the distribution is centered barley above zero!

Here are the top 10 funds overall, note that many of these funds did not exist for a long time.

And here are the top funds for a few selected years:

And how have these funds done?

# Wrap Up 

It seems like there is no free lunch on momentum funds.  They charge higher fees, and have worse performance than index funds.  Further, they don't seem to be trading momentum.
