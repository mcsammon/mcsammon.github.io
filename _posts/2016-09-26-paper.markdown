title:  "New Working Paper - Pricing Dollar Strength Risk"
---
This is a new joint work with Marcelo Bianconi.  Any comments are welcome.

**Abstract:** The strength of the dollar has an immediate impact on domestic firms - lowering the cost of imports, increasing the cost of exports and making US consumers richer.  Stocks which covary positively with changes in a trade-weighted US dollar index earn higher expected returns than stocks which covary negatively with the index. A zero-cost tradeable factor designed to capture this effect is not priced by established factors.  Our dollar strength factor has implications for profitability and fundamental momentum, as well as the relationship between momentum strategies in different countries.
