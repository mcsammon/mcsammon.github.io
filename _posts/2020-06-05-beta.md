title:  "Thinking About Beta"
---

I recently recorded a series of video lectures for an introduction to Finance class at Kellogg.  One of the topics we cover is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Recording this class got me thinking about the "<a href="
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-volatility_anomaly" title="b1">here</a>" for the first time in years.  


My first interest in beta was near the end of the second year of my PhD program.  I I needed to write a second-year paper, and at the time, I was replicating the Betting Against Beta (BAB) paper by Frazzini and Pedersen. Although the paper is extremly well cited (at the time of writing, the BAB paper has over 1500 citations), I thought I could provide a different explanation for why low beta stocks tend to outperform high beta stocks.

In this post, I will provide a quick review of the CAPM, examine the returns of beta-sorted portfolios, and see how sensitive the beta anomaly is to various sorting modifications.  While I've personally constructed all these beta-sorted portfolios, rather than use my replication for the BAB factor constructed in the Frazzini and Pedersen paper, I will use the data published by AQR <a href="https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Datasets/Betting-Against-Beta-Equity-Factors-Monthly" title="b1">here</a>.

# Why Bet Against Beta?

There are two pieces of the CAPM.  The first is the CAPM regression:
\begin{equation}
r_{i,t}-r_{f,t}=a_i + \beta_i (r_{m,t}-r_{f,t}) + e_{i,t}
\end{equation}
where $$r_{i,t}$$ is the return on stock $$i$$ at time $$t$$, $$r_{m,t}$$ is the return on the market, $$r_{f,t}$$ is the risk-free rate, $$\beta$$ is the CAPM beta. The CAPM regression says that moves in the market can explain some of the moves in the stock, but is estimated with error, $$e_{i,t}$$, so it cannot explain everything.  

The second is the CAPM equation:
\begin{equation}
E[r_i]=r_f+\beta MRP
\end{equation}
where $$MRP$$ is the market risk premium i.e. the compenstion for bearing market risk.  There are still stock-specific risks.  There is no error, however, in the CAPM equation.  According to the CAPM, stocks with higher betas should have higher expected i.e. average returns.  And this is the *only* reason stocks should have different expected returns.  Empirically, however, this does not hold. There are many explanations for the failure of the CAPM, but the most well known is *Capital market equilibrium with restricted borrowing*, written by Fischer Black in 1972.  This paper argues that 

This logic is the motivation for the model in BAB.

There are other explanations for the beta anomaly, like that it is demand for lottery-like stocks (see e.g.  Bali, Turan G., et al. "Betting against beta or demand for lottery." (2014)) or that is is the result of non-standard sorting procedures 
(see e.g. Novy-Marx, Robert, and Mihail Velikov. "Betting against betting against beta." (2018)). 

Things in the paper that seem non-standard when I was first reading it: (1) Not using value weights (2) Making the portfolio beta-neutral.  First, I will go through how I would form these portfolios, then I will examine the effects of changing the weights, and making the portfolio beta neutral.  By going through these, it will lead to my explanation, which is that through these non-standard procedures, we will reveal something deeper about the BAB strategy.

# Basic Sorting

Calculate beta over past year using daily returns.  Require 
Follow Hou, Xue and Zhang (2020), and form 10 portfolios based on NYSE breakpoints, and value-weights.  Restrict to ordinary common shares.

# Weights

What happens if we use equal-weighted portfolios instead of value-weighted portfolios?

What happens if we use beta-weighted portfolios, which is what Frazzini and Pedersen do in the Betting Against Beta paper?

# Making the Portfolio Beta Neutral 

Shrink all betas toward one following Frazzini and Pedersen $$ \beta=0.6 \times \beta_{past year}+0.4 \times 1$$ with the idea that the mean cross-sectional beta must be one.  To do this, I take the return of the lowest beta portfolios, and multiply it by one over the (value-weighted) average beta i.e. 1/beta, measured over the past year.  This will increase the leverage on the low-beta portfolio, and decrease leverage on the high beta portfolios.  If betas were constant, the portfolio would then have a beta of one.

# Time Period

Suppose we look at the return of the beta-sorted portfolios by decade

Is this a function of 10 being too many portfolios? Maybe the super extreme betas are not well measured.  Do it again with 5 portfolios for the value-weighted and equal weighted specifications.

What happens if we attempt to make our beta factor market-neutral?

It does not work for the equal weighted portfolios.

# Time-Varying Weights

Making the portfolio beta neutral is putting time-varying weights on the long/short sides of the portfolio
