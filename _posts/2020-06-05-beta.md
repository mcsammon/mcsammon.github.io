title:  "Thinking About Beta"
---

I recently recorded a series of video lectures for an introduction to Finance class at Kellogg.  One of the topics we cover is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Recording this class got me thinking about the "<a href="
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-volatility_anomaly" title="b1">beta anomaly</a>" for the first time in years.  

My first interest in beta was near the end of the second year of my PhD program.  I needed to write a second-year paper, and at the time, I was replicating the Betting Against Beta (BAB) paper by Frazzini and Pedersen. Although their paper is extremly well cited (at the time of writing, the BAB paper has over 1500 citations), I thought I could provide a different explanation for why low beta stocks tend to outperform high beta stocks.  Although I never even self-published that paper, I think the results are interesting enough to post here on my blog.

In this post, I will provide a quick review of the CAPM, examine the returns of beta-sorted portfolios, and see how sensitive the results are to various sorting modifications.  While I've personally constructed all these beta-sorted portfolios, rather than use my replication for the BAB factor in the Frazzini and Pedersen paper, I will use the data published by AQR <a href="https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Datasets/Betting-Against-Beta-Equity-Factors-Monthly" title="b1">here</a>.

# Why Bet Against Beta?

There are two pieces of the CAPM.  The first is the CAPM regression:
\begin{equation}
r_{i,t}-r_{f,t}=a_i + \beta_i (r_{m,t}-r_{f,t}) + e_{i,t}
\end{equation}
where $$r_{i,t}$$ is the return on stock $$i$$ at time $$t$$, $$r_{m,t}$$ is the return on the market, $$r_{f,t}$$ is the risk-free rate and $$\beta_i$$ is the CAPM beta. The CAPM regression has little content: moves in the market might be able to explain some of the moves in stocks, but there is error i.e. moves in the stock not explained by the market, $$e_{i,t}$$.  This error is firm-specific risk, and the CAPM puts no restriction on how large its variance, $$Var(e_{i,t})$$, can be.  The main use for the CAPM regression is to estimate $$\beta_i$$ and use it in the CAPM equation.

The second piece is the CAPM equation:
\begin{equation}
E[r_i]=r_f+\beta_i MRP
\end{equation}
where $$MRP$$ is the market risk premium i.e. the compenstion for bearing market risk. In a future post, I will talk about how we might measure the market risk premium. In the CAPM equation, there is no error: stocks with higher betas should have higher expected returns.  And this is the *only* reason stocks should have different expected returns.  

Empirically, however, the opposite is true: low beta stocks tend to have higher (risk-adjusted) returns than high beta stocks.  There are many explanations for this failure of the CAPM, but one of the most well known is in *Capital market equilibrium with restricted borrowing*, written by Fischer Black in 1972.  This paper argues that the beta anomaly exists because one can not actually borrow/lend unlimited amounts at the risk free rate (an assumption in the CAPM).  To achieve high returns with low beta stocks, an investor whould have to apply leverage, which is not cheap (unless you are  <a href="http://docs.lhpedersen.com/BuffettsAlpha.pdf" title="b1">Warren Buffett</a>).  So, with limited leverage, investors can only achieve high returns with high beta stocks.  This leads to excess demand for these high beta stocks, pushing up their prices, and pushing down their expected returns. Limits on leverage are also the key mechanism in the theoretical model in the BAB paper.

There are other explanations for the beta anomaly, like that it is demand for lottery-like stocks (see e.g.  Bali, Turan G., et al. "Betting against beta or demand for lottery." (2014)) or that it is the result of non-standard sorting procedures 
(see e.g. Novy-Marx, Robert, and Mihail Velikov. "Betting against betting against beta." (2018)). 

I am more sympathetic to the non-standard sorting procedure argument, as there are a few things in the paper that seemed unusual when I was first reading it: (1) Not using value weights (2) Applying time-varying leverage to the long and short sides of the portfolio.  

In the next few sections, I will go through how I would form these portfolios, then I will examine the effects of changing the weights, and adding the time-varying leverage.  By going through these non-standard sorting procedures, we will reveal something deeper about the BAB strategy.

# Basic Sorting

Calculate beta over past year using daily returns.  Require 
Follow Hou, Xue and Zhang (2020), and form 10 portfolios based on NYSE breakpoints, and value-weights.  Restrict to ordinary common shares.

# Weights

What happens if we use equal-weighted portfolios instead of value-weighted portfolios?

What happens if we use beta-weighted portfolios, which is what Frazzini and Pedersen do in the Betting Against Beta paper?

# Making the Portfolio Beta Neutral 

Shrink all betas toward one following Frazzini and Pedersen $$ \beta=0.6 \times \beta_{past year}+0.4 \times 1$$ with the idea that the mean cross-sectional beta must be one.  To do this, I take the return of the lowest beta portfolios, and multiply it by one over the (value-weighted) average beta i.e. 1/beta, measured over the past year.  This will increase the leverage on the low-beta portfolio, and decrease leverage on the high beta portfolios.  If betas were constant, the portfolio would then have a beta of one.

# Time Period

Suppose we look at the return of the beta-sorted portfolios by decade

Is this a function of 10 being too many portfolios? Maybe the super extreme betas are not well measured.  Do it again with 5 portfolios for the value-weighted and equal weighted specifications.

What happens if we attempt to make our beta factor market-neutral?

It does not work for the equal weighted portfolios.

# Time-Varying Weights

Making the portfolio beta neutral is putting time-varying weights on the long/short sides of the portfolio
