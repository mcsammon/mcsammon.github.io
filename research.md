**Abstract:**  How does passive ownership affect the incorporation of information into stock prices? Focusing on the period before earnings announcements, I find price informativeness declined over the past 30 years and passive ownership is negatively correlated with price informativeness.  To establish causality, I show price informativeness decreases after quasi-exogenous increases in passive ownership arising from index additions/rebalancing.  My proposed mechanism is that passive ownership decreases learning about stock-specific information.  Consistent with this, high passive ownership stocks receive less attention from analysts and institutional investors, have more ex-ante earnings uncertainty, are traded less before earnings announcements and react more to fundamental news.

**Abstract:**   FTSE/Russell reconstitutes its Russell 1000 and 2000 indexes on the last Friday of June each year, and it announces which stocks will switch indexes roughly two weeks in advance. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) must do all of their rebalancing on Russell's reconstitution day, but other kinds of funds (mutual funds, pension funds, endowments, etc) could use this two-week period to gradually rebalance. Textbook models suggest that some non-ETFs should take advantage of this opportunity. Yet index-switcher volume does not increase at all during the period prior to Russell's reconstitution day. It suddenly spikes on reconstitution day with 3.15 times more volume than can be explained by ETF rebalancing alone. The existence of so much excess reconstitution-day volume suggests that there are important economic forces missing from existing models of index investing. It is as if all Russell-linked funds are trading like ETFs even though most of these funds do not face the same end-of-day portfolio constraints that ETFs do.

**Abstract:**  We examine next-day newspaper accounts of large daily jumps in 19 national stock markets to assess their proximate cause, clarity as to cause, and geographic source of the market-moving news. Our sample of over 8,000 jumps yields several findings. First, policy news triggers a greater share of upward than downward jumps in all countries. Second, the policy share of upward jumps is inversely related to stock market performance in the preceding three months. These two patterns reflect the role of jumps triggered by monetary policy and government spending and have strengthened since World War II. Third, market volatility is much lower after jumps triggered by monetary policy news than after other similarly sized jumps, unconditionally and conditional on past volatility and other controls. Fourth, greater clarity as to jump reason also foreshadows lower volatility. Clarity has trended upwards over the past 90 years in the US and UK, the two countries for which we have long-span data. Finally, leading newspapers outside the U.S. attribute one-third of jumps in their own national stock markets to developments that originate in and relate to the United States. The U.S. role in this regard dwarfs that of Europe and China.

**Abstract:**  Intangible capital is a crucial and growing piece of firms' capital structure and helps to explain long run trends in concentration and markups. We develop new firm level metrics regarding a key component of intangible capital -- customer churn -- using a class of household transaction data that is increasingly available to researchers around the world. We show that customer attachment is associated with higher markups and market to book ratios and can help to explain many dimensions of firm-level volatility and risk in both real outcomes and asset prices. This new measure provides a more direct indicator of firms' customer and brand capital than existing metrics like SG&A, R&D, or advertising expenditures and is also available for private firms. We demonstrate that low levels of customer churn push firms away from neoclassical investment responsiveness and that low churn firms are better able insulate organization capital from the risk of key talent flight.

Using a large panel of U.S. accounts trades and positions, we show that retail investors trade as contrarians after large earnings surprises, especially for loser stocks, and such contrarian trading contributes to post earnings announcement drift (PEAD) and momentum. Indeed, when we double-sort by momentum portfolios and retail trading flows, PEAD and momentum are only present in the top two quintiles of retail trading intensity. Finer sorts confirm the results, as do sorts by firm size and institutional ownership level. We show that the investors in our sample are representative of the universe of U.S. retail traders, and that the magnitude of the phenomena we describe indicate a quantitively substantial role of retail investors in generating momentum. The results on the timing of the flows and the magnitude of the return differences across momentum portfolios by retail trading intensity and size and sign of the earnings surprise, are confirmed at a longer two-year horizon. Alternative hypotheses, such as the disposition effect and stale limit orders, do not explain the phenomenon. We find that younger investors and day traders are more likely to be contrarians, while gender and number of trades are not correlated with our contrarian score, once other characteristics are controlled for. The pattern of web-clicks and the time spent analyzing each stock on the brokerage platform suggest an important role of attention in contrarian trading.

**Abstract:** A recent literature has documented large real effects of trade policy uncertainty (TPU) on trade, employment, and investment, but there is little evidence that investors are compensated for bearing such risk. To quantify the risk premium associated with TPU, we exploit quasi-experimental variation in exposure to TPU arising from Congressional votes to revoke China's preferential tariff treatment between 1990 and 2001. A long-short portfolio designed to isolate exposure to TPU earns a risk-adjusted return of 3.6-6.2% per year. This effect is larger in sectors less protected from globalization, and more reliant on inputs from China. Industries more exposed to trade policy uncertainty also had a larger drop in stock prices when the uncertainty began, and more volatile returns around key policy dates. Our results are not explained by the effects of policy uncertainty on expected cash-flows, investors' forecast errors, and import competition from China.

**Abstract:** No previous infectious disease outbreak, including the Spanish Flu, has impacted the stock market as forcefully as the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, previous pandemics left only mild traces on the U.S. stock market. We use text-based methods to develop these points with respect to large daily stock market moves back to 1900 and with respect to overall stock market volatility back to 1985. We also evaluate potential explanations for the unprecedented stock market reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence we amass suggests that government restrictions on commercial activity and voluntary social distancing, operating with powerful effects in a service-oriented economy, are the main reasons the U.S. stock market reacted so much more forcefully to COVID-19 than to previous pandemics in 1918-19, 1957-58 and 1968.

**Abstract:** We find that money managers could reduce portfolio risk by incorporating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria into their investment process. ESG-related issues can cause sudden regulatory changes and shifts in consumer tastes, resulting in large asset price swings which leave investors limited time to react. By incorporating ESG criteria in their investment strategy, money managers can tilt their holdings towards firms which are well prepared to deal with these changes, thereby managing exposure to these rare but potentially large risks.
