**Abstract:** The relative strength of the U.S. dollar does not explain the cross-section of expected returns.
We find, however, that signed sensitivity of individual firmsâ€™ returns to moves in dollar
strength matters for asset pricing. A portfolio that goes long high-dollar-sensitivity stocks and
short low-dollar-sensitivity stocks earns a multi-factor alpha of 3%-7% per year. Sorting on
dollar sensitivity captures firm fundamentals - in particular fraction of revenue from abroad.
Dollar sensitivity has implications for profitability and fundamental momentum, as well as
the relationship between momentum strategies across countries.

# Environmental, Social, and Governance Criteria: Why Investors Should Care

**Abstract:** We examine why money managers should consider Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria when making investment decisions, focusing on the E (environmental) part to illustrate the issues and mechanisms involved. Given their increased severity and frequency, environmental crises are more likely to cause sudden changes in regulations, consumer tastes, and the emergence of disruptive technologies. These changes can cause large swings in asset prices, leaving investors with limited ability to react. By incorporating ESG criteria in their investment strategy, money managers can proactively select firms which are well prepared to deal with these changes, and protect themselves from downside risk.

**Abstract:** We numerically solve systems of Black-Scholes formulas for implied
volatility and implied risk-free rate of return. After using a seemingly
unrelated regressions (SUR) model to obtain point estimates for implied
volatility and implied risk-free rate, the options are re-priced using these
parameters.

After repricing, the difference between the market price and model price is
increasing in time to expiration, while the effect of moneyness and the bid-ask
spread are ambiguous.

Our varying risk-free rate model yields Black- Scholes prices closer to market
prices than the fixed risk-free rate model. In addition, our model is better
for predicting future evolutions in model-free implied volatility as measured
by the VIX.
