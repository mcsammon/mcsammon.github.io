**Abstract:** This paper proposes a way to measure the effect of rising passive ownership on stock price
informativeness that does not rely on any particular model. I examine patterns in trad-
ing volume, returns and volatility around days we know information is released: earnings
announcements. Between 1990 and 2018, pre-earnings abnormal trading volume and the
pre-earnings drift declined, while the share of annual volatility on earnings days increased.
At the firm-level, there is a negative relationship between passive ownership and pre-earnings
price informativeness. This result is robust to using only quasi-exogenous increases in pas-
sive ownership associated with S&P 500 additions and Russell 1000/2000 rebalancing. I
link increases in passive ownership to decreases in information gathering: increases in pas-
sive ownership are correlated with fewer analysts covering a stock, fewer downloads of SEC
filings, and a larger response to earnings news.

# ETFs, Learning and Price Informativeness (Updated 3/2020)

*Draft coming soon*

**Abstract:** This paper studies how introducing an ETF can change investors' allocation of
limited attention. In a rational-expectations model, informed agents decide how much
to learn about individual stocks, or a systematic risk-factor. Introducing an ETF does
not universally increase or decrease learning about systematic risk. If the volatility
of the systematic risk-factor is large, risk aversion is high, or the cost of becoming
informed is high, introducing the ETF leads investors to devote more attention to the
systematic risk factor. Otherwise, the ETF may lead investors investors to learn more
about the individual stocks. I decompose the effect of introducing the ETF into 3
channels: (1) Changes in the share of agents who decide to become informed (2) Reallocation
of attention among informed investors (3) Decreases in risk premia. I review
empirical evidence consistent with increased ETF ownership of stocks leading to less
informative prices and decreased learning.

**Abstract:** We exploit quasi-experimental variation in exposure to trade policy uncertainty between 1990 and 2001, arising from the US-China trade relationships, to show that US tradeable industries more exposed to trade policy uncertainty commanded a risk premium of 6% per year. The risk premium was larger in sectors less protected from globalization, and more reliant on inputs from China. Consistent with asset pricing models in which investors require compensation for policy uncertainty, we also document that more exposed industries had larger changes in stock prices at key policy dates, and more volatile returns of policy uncertainty. We further show that neither the effect of policy uncertainty on expected cash-flows, nor investors' forecast errors, nor import competition from China can explain our results.

# What Triggers National Stock Market Jumps? (New Slides 3/2020)

Main Findings: 
1) 36% US jumps attributed to policy categories (and 41% internationally).  Policy includes government spending, monetary policy and regulation.  Non-policy includes macroeconomic news, corporate earnings & outlook and commodities.
2) Realized volatility is lower following policy-driven jumps, relative to non-policy jumps of the same magnitude and sign.  We measure realized volatility as the sum of squared daily returns in the 22 trading days following the jump.
3) Outside the US, newspapers attribute 34% of jumps to US developments â€“ above the US's 11% share of global GDP.  The share of jumps attributed to the US has been rising over time.
4) Volatility and trading volume are lower after jumps with high clarity.  We define clarity as the first principal component of (1) agreement across newspapers describing the same jump (2) how confidently the journalist advanced their explanation (3) how easy it was to categorize the article (4) one minus the share of newspapers that did not give an explanation for the jump.

**Abstract:** We find that money managers could reduce portfolio risk by incorporating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria into their investment process. ESG-related issues can cause sudden regulatory changes and shifts in consumer tastes, resulting in large asset price swings which leave investors limited time to react. By incorporating ESG criteria in their investment strategy, money managers can tilt their holdings towards firms which are well prepared to deal with these changes, thereby managing exposure to these rare but potentially large risks.
