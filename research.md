# What Triggers National Stock Market Jumps?

Joint with Scott Baker, Nicholas Bloom and Steven Davis

**Abstract:** Based on readings of next-day newspaper articles, we catalog the proximate cause and geographic source of all largest 1% of daily stock market movements in 14 countries over the past 30 years. Our catalog extends back to 1930 for the United Kingdom and to 1900 for the United States. Using the United States as a test case, we compare categorizations across several newspapers and human coders, obtaining consistent results. News about the United States plays a disproportionate role in triggering large equity moves around the world in recent decades, relative to the U.S. share of world output.  The reverse pattern, of large U.S. equity moves in response to foreign news, is comparatively rare. Across almost all countries, the share of large stock market moves associated with government policy increased during and after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-09.  We show that shocks of different types and geographic origins are associated with significant differences in returns and both implied and realized volatility.

**Abstract:** The relative strength of the U.S. dollar does not explain the cross-section of expected returns.
We find, however, that signed sensitivity of individual firmsâ€™ returns to moves in dollar
strength matters for asset pricing. A portfolio that goes long high-dollar-sensitivity stocks and
short low-dollar-sensitivity stocks earns a multi-factor alpha of 3%-7% per year. Sorting on
dollar sensitivity captures firm fundamentals - in particular fraction of revenue from abroad.
Dollar sensitivity has implications for profitability and fundamental momentum, as well as
the relationship between momentum strategies across countries.

**Abstract:** We find that money managers could reduce portfolio risk by incorporating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria into their investment process. ESG-related issues can cause sudden regulatory changes and shifts in consumer tastes, resulting in large asset price swings which leave investors limited time to react. By incorporating ESG criteria in their investment strategy, money managers can tilt their holdings towards firms which are well prepared to deal with these changes, thereby managing exposure to these rare but potentially large risks.


# Implied Volatility and the Risk-Free Rate of Return in Options Markets (Published 1/2015)

**Abstract:** We numerically solve systems of Black-Scholes formulas for implied
volatility and implied risk-free rate of return. After using a seemingly
unrelated regressions (SUR) model to obtain point estimates for implied
volatility and implied risk-free rate, the options are re-priced using these
parameters.

After repricing, the difference between the market price and model price is
increasing in time to expiration, while the effect of moneyness and the bid-ask
spread are ambiguous.

Our varying risk-free rate model yields Black- Scholes prices closer to market
prices than the fixed risk-free rate model. In addition, our model is better
for predicting future evolutions in model-free implied volatility as measured
by the VIX.
