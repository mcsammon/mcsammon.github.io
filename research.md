**Abstract:**   Passive investors held 37.8% of the US stock market in 2020. This estimate comes from studying the closing volumes of index additions and deletions on reconstitution days. It reflects the holdings of both index funds and direct indexers. The previous estimate, 15%, assumed all passive investing was done via index funds. Existing models for rising passive ownership are calibrated to this previous estimate and give no hint it is 50% too small, which limits how useful these models are to policymakers. Direct indexing also helps empirical researchers make sense of recent market trends, like the growth in buybacks.

**Abstract:** Retail investors trade hard-to-value stocks. Controlling for size, stocks with a high share of retail-initiated trades are composed of more intangible capital, have longer duration cash-flows and a higher likelihood of being mispriced. Consistent with retail-heavy stocks being harder to value, we document that such stocks are less sensitive to earnings news. As an additional consequence, the well-known earnings announcer risk premium is limited to low retail stocks only.  Further, high-retail stocks are more sensitive to retail order flow and are especially expensive to trade around earnings announcements. Overall, the findings document a new dimension of investor heterogeneity and suggest the comparative advantage of retail in holding hard-to-value stocks. 

# Intangible Capital and Customer Churn (Updated 10/2022)

**Abstract:**  Intangible capital is a crucial and growing piece of firms' capital structure, but the multitude of distinct components are difficult to measure. We develop and make available several new firm-level metrics regarding a key component of intangible capital -- firms' customer bases -- using an increasingly common class of household transaction data. Linking household spending to customer-facing firms that make up over 30% of consumer spending, we show that churn in customer bases is associated with lower markups and market-to-book ratios and higher leverage. Churn is closely linked to firm-level volatility and risk, both cross-sectionally and over time. This new measure provides a clearer picture of firms' customer and brand capital than existing metrics like capitalized SG&A, R&D, or advertising expenditures and is also observable for private firms. We demonstrate that low levels of customer churn push firms away from neoclassical investment responsiveness and that low churn firms are better able to insulate organization capital from the risk of key talent flight.

**Abstract:**  I show that passive ownership negatively affects the degree to which stock prices anticipate earnings announcements.  Estimates across several research designs imply that the rise in passive ownership over the last 30 years has caused the amount of information incorporated into prices ahead of earnings announcements to decline by roughly 16%.  This effect occurs in part because passive owners collect less firm-specific information ahead of earnings announcements and limits to arbitrage prevent non-passive investors from fully offsetting this 
behavior.

# What Triggers National Stock Market Jumps? (Updated 2/2022)

**Abstract:**  We examine next-day newspaper accounts of large daily jumps in 19 national stock markets to assess their proximate cause, clarity as to cause, and geographic source of the market-moving news. Our sample of over 8,000 jumps yields several findings. First, policy news triggers a greater share of upward than downward jumps in all countries. Second, the policy share of upward jumps is inversely related to stock market performance in the preceding three months. These two patterns reflect the role of jumps triggered by monetary policy and government spending and have strengthened since World War II. Third, market volatility is much lower after jumps triggered by monetary policy news than after other similarly sized jumps, unconditionally and conditional on past volatility and other controls. Fourth, greater clarity as to jump reason also foreshadows lower volatility. Clarity has trended upwards over the past 90 years in the US and UK, the two countries for which we have long-span data. Finally, leading newspapers outside the U.S. attribute one-third of jumps in their own national stock markets to developments that originate in and relate to the United States. The U.S. role in this regard dwarfs that of Europe and China.

# Retail Investors' Contrarian Behavior Around News and the Momentum Effect (Updated 11/2021)

Using a large panel of U.S. accounts trades and positions, we show that retail investors trade as contrarians after large earnings surprises, especially for loser stocks, and such contrarian trading contributes to post earnings announcement drift (PEAD) and momentum. Indeed, when we double-sort by momentum portfolios and retail trading flows, PEAD and momentum are only present in the top two quintiles of retail trading intensity. Finer sorts confirm the results, as do sorts by firm size and institutional ownership level. We show that the investors in our sample are representative of the universe of U.S. retail traders, and that the magnitude of the phenomena we describe indicate a quantitively substantial role of retail investors in generating momentum. The results on the timing of the flows and the magnitude of the return differences across momentum portfolios by retail trading intensity and size and sign of the earnings surprise, are confirmed at a longer two-year horizon. Alternative hypotheses, such as the disposition effect and stale limit orders, do not explain the phenomenon. We find that younger investors and day traders are more likely to be contrarians, while gender and number of trades are not correlated with our contrarian score, once other characteristics are controlled for. The pattern of web-clicks and the time spent analyzing each stock on the brokerage platform suggest an important role of attention in contrarian trading.

# Trade Policy Uncertainty and Stock Returns (Journal of International Money and Finance, September 2021)

**Abstract:** A recent literature has documented large real effects of trade policy uncertainty (TPU) on trade, employment, and investment, but there is little evidence that investors are compensated for bearing such risk. To quantify the risk premium associated with TPU, we exploit quasi-experimental variation in exposure to TPU arising from Congressional votes to revoke China's preferential tariff treatment between 1990 and 2001. A long-short portfolio designed to isolate exposure to TPU earns a risk-adjusted return of 3.6-6.2% per year. This effect is larger in sectors less protected from globalization, and more reliant on inputs from China. Industries more exposed to trade policy uncertainty also had a larger drop in stock prices when the uncertainty began, and more volatile returns around key policy dates. Our results are not explained by the effects of policy uncertainty on expected cash-flows, investors' forecast errors, and import competition from China.

**Abstract:** No previous infectious disease outbreak, including the Spanish Flu, has impacted the stock market as forcefully as the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, previous pandemics left only mild traces on the U.S. stock market. We use text-based methods to develop these points with respect to large daily stock market moves back to 1900 and with respect to overall stock market volatility back to 1985. We also evaluate potential explanations for the unprecedented stock market reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence we amass suggests that government restrictions on commercial activity and voluntary social distancing, operating with powerful effects in a service-oriented economy, are the main reasons the U.S. stock market reacted so much more forcefully to COVID-19 than to previous pandemics in 1918-19, 1957-58 and 1968.

**Abstract:** We find that money managers could reduce portfolio risk by incorporating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria into their investment process. ESG-related issues can cause sudden regulatory changes and shifts in consumer tastes, resulting in large asset price swings which leave investors limited time to react. By incorporating ESG criteria in their investment strategy, money managers can tilt their holdings towards firms which are well prepared to deal with these changes, thereby managing exposure to these rare but potentially large risks.
