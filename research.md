**Abstract:** We numerically solve systems of Black-Scholes formulas for implied
volatility and implied risk-free rate of return. After using a seemingly
unrelated regressions (SUR) model to obtain point estimates for implied
volatility and implied risk-free rate, the options are re-priced using these
parameters.

After repricing, the difference between the market price and model price is
increasing in time to expiration, while the effect of moneyness and the bid-ask
spread are ambiguous.

Our varying risk-free rate model yields Black- Scholes prices closer to market
prices than the fixed risk-free rate model. In addition, our model is better
for predicting future evolutions in model-free implied volatility as measured
by the VIX.
