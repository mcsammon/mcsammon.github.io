**Abstract:** This paper proposes a way to measure the effect of rising passive ownership on stock price
informativeness that does not rely on any particular model. I examine patterns in trad-
ing volume, returns and volatility around days we know information is released: earnings
announcements. Between 1990 and 2018, pre-earnings abnormal trading volume and the
pre-earnings drift declined, while the share of annual volatility on earnings days increased.
At the firm-level, there is a negative relationship between passive ownership and pre-earnings
price informativeness. This result is robust to using only quasi-exogenous increases in pas-
sive ownership associated with S&P 500 additions and Russell 1000/2000 rebalancing. I
link increases in passive ownership to decreases in information gathering: increases in pas-
sive ownership are correlated with fewer analysts covering a stock, fewer downloads of SEC
filings, and a larger response to earnings news.

**Abstract:** This paper studies how the introduction of ETFs, and the growth of ETF ownership, can change investors' learning behavior.  I develop a rational-expectations model where agents decide (1) whether they want to become informed or not and (2) if informed, how to allocate their limited attention between learning about individual stocks and a systematic risk-factor.  Introducing an ETF does not universally increase or decrease learning about systematic risk.  If the volatility of the systematic risk-factor is large, risk aversion is high, or the cost of becoming informed is high, introducing the ETF leads investors to devote more attention to the systematic risk-factor.  Otherwise, the ETF may lead investors investors to learn more about the individual stocks.  I decompose the effect of introducing the ETF into 2 channels: (1) Changes in the share of agents who decide to become informed (2) Re-allocation of attention among informed investors.  I then extend the model, allowing an intermediary to buy the underlying stocks and create more shares of the ETF. Finally, I link the model's predictions to empirical evidence on the growth of ETF ownership and less informative stock prices.


# Firm Customer Bases: Churn and Networks (Updated 5/2020)

**Abstract:**  Using consumer transaction data, this paper demonstrates that it is possible to construct accurate pictures of firm revenue, growth, geographic dispersion, and customer base characteristics. We develop two new measures which characterize firms’ customer bases: the rate of churn in a firm’s customer base and a metric of the pairwise similarity between firms’ customer bases. We show that these measures provide important insights into the behavior of both real firm decisions and firm asset prices. Rates of customer churn affect the level and volatility of firm-level investment, markups, and profits. Churn also affects how quickly firms respond to shocks in the value of their growth options (i.e. Tobin’s Q). Moreover, high churn firms tended to face steeper declines in consumer spending during the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Similarity between firms’ customer bases highlights one under-explored type of predictability among stock returns – we demonstrate that significant alpha can be generated using a trading strategy that exploits our index of customer base similarity across firms.

**Abstract:** We examine how trade policy uncertainty is reflected in stock returns. Our identification
strategy exploits quasi-experimental variation in exposure to trade policy uncertainty
arising from Congressional votes to revoke China's preferential tariff treatment between
1990 and 2001. More exposed industries commanded a risk premium of 6% per year.
The risk premium was larger in sectors less protected from globalization, and more
reliant on inputs from China. More exposed industries also had a larger drop in stock
prices when the uncertainty began, and more volatile returns around key policy dates.
Moreover, the effects of policy uncertainty on expected cash-flows, investors' forecast
errors, and import competition from China cannot explain our results.

# What Triggers National Stock Market Jumps?

Main Findings: 
1) 36% US jumps attributed to policy categories (and 41% internationally).  Policy includes government spending, monetary policy and regulation.  Non-policy includes macroeconomic news, corporate earnings & outlook and commodities.
2) Realized volatility is lower following policy-driven jumps, relative to non-policy jumps of the same magnitude and sign.  We measure realized volatility as the sum of squared daily returns in the 22 trading days following the jump.
3) Outside the US, newspapers attribute 34% of jumps to US developments – above the US's 11% share of global GDP.  The share of jumps attributed to the US has been rising over time.
4) Volatility and trading volume are lower after jumps with high clarity.  We define clarity as the first principal component of (1) agreement across newspapers describing the same jump (2) how confidently the journalist advanced their explanation (3) how easy it was to categorize the article (4) one minus the share of newspapers that did not give an explanation for the jump.

**Abstract:** No previous infectious disease outbreak, including the Spanish Flu, has impacted the stock market as forcefully as the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, previous pandemics left only mild traces on the U.S. stock market. We use text-based methods to develop these points with respect to large daily stock market moves back to 1900 and with respect to overall stock market volatility back to 1985. We also evaluate potential explanations for the unprecedented stock market reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence we amass suggests that government restrictions on commercial activity and voluntary social distancing, operating with powerful effects in a service-oriented economy, are the main reasons the U.S. stock market reacted so much more forcefully to COVID-19 than to previous pandemics in 1918-19, 1957-58 and 1968.

**Abstract:** We find that money managers could reduce portfolio risk by incorporating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria into their investment process. ESG-related issues can cause sudden regulatory changes and shifts in consumer tastes, resulting in large asset price swings which leave investors limited time to react. By incorporating ESG criteria in their investment strategy, money managers can tilt their holdings towards firms which are well prepared to deal with these changes, thereby managing exposure to these rare but potentially large risks.
