**Abstract:** The strength of the dollar has an immediate impact on domestic firms - lowering the cost of imports, increasing the cost of exports and making US consumers richer.  Stocks which covary positively with changes in a trade-weighted US dollar index earn higher expected returns than stocks which covary negatively with the index. A zero-cost tradeable factor designed to capture this effect is not priced by established factors.  Our dollar strength factor has implications for profitability and fundamental momentum, as well as the relationship between momentum strategies in different countries.

[Published in the North American Journal of Economics and Finance (January 2015)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062940814001089#)

**Abstract:** We numerically solve systems of Black-Scholes formulas for implied
volatility and implied risk-free rate of return. After using a seemingly
unrelated regressions (SUR) model to obtain point estimates for implied
volatility and implied risk-free rate, the options are re-priced using these
parameters.

After repricing, the difference between the market price and model price is
increasing in time to expiration, while the effect of moneyness and the bid-ask
spread are ambiguous.

Our varying risk-free rate model yields Black- Scholes prices closer to market
prices than the fixed risk-free rate model. In addition, our model is better
for predicting future evolutions in model-free implied volatility as measured
by the VIX.
