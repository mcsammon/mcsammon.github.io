**Abstract:**  Stocks that switch between the Russell 1000 and 2000 experience an economically massive spike in volume on Russell's reconstitution day. When a stock moves between these two indexes, ETFs benchmarked to either index must change their holdings. Such rebalancing typically increases an index switcher's reconstitution-day volume by 140% relative to its average daily volume during the previous year. Our main finding is that, for every share traded due to ETF rebalancing, an additional 3.1 shares get traded by somebody else. The dollar value of this excess reconstitution-day volume is on the same order of magnitude as the annual growth of Russell-benchmarked ETFs. Yet this phenomenon is entirely unexpected based on textbook asset-pricing reasoning, meaning that understanding excess reconstitution-day volume has the potential to yield theoretical dividends.

**Abstract:**  How does passive ownership affect the incorporation of information into stock prices? Motivated by two canonical models, I propose three new empirical measures of price informativeness.  I find average price informativeness declined over the past 30 years and passive ownership is negatively correlated with price informativeness.  To establish causality, I show that price informativeness decreases after quasi-exogenous increases in passive ownership arising from index additions and rebalancing. Finally, I provide evidence for a mechanism: investors expend less effort gathering information about stocks with a larger fraction of passive owners.

**Abstract:**  Intangible capital is a crucial and growing piece of firms' capital structure and helps to explain long run trends in concentration and markups. We develop new firm level metrics regarding a key component of intangible capital -- customer churn -- using a class of household transaction data that is increasingly available to researchers around the world. We show that customer attachment is associated with higher markups and market to book ratios and can help to explain many dimensions of firm-level volatility and risk in both real outcomes and asset prices. This new measure provides a more direct indicator of firms' customer and brand capital than existing metrics like SG&A, R&D, or advertising expenditures and is also available for private firms. We demonstrate that low levels of customer churn push firms away from neoclassical investment responsiveness and that low churn firms are better able insulate organization capital from the risk of key talent flight.

We examine newspapers the day after major stock-market jumps to evaluate the proximate cause, geographic source, and clarity of these events from 1900 in the US and 1980 (or earlier) in 13 other countries. We find four main results. First, the United States plays an outsized role in global stock markets, accounting for 35% of jumps outside the US since the 1980s. Second, policy causes a higher share of positive than negative jumps in all countries we examine. Monetary policy and government spending jumps are the most over-represented in positive jumps, suggesting major policy announcements are usually in response to negative shocks. Third, jumps caused by non-policy events (particularly macroeconomic news) lead to higher future volatility, while jumps caused by policy events (particularly monetary policy) reduce future volatility. Finally, the clarity of the cause of stock market jumps has increased substantially since 1900 as news and financial markets have become more transparent. Jump clarity predicts future stock returns volatility: doubling the clarity of a jump reduces future volatility by 68%.

We study the role of retail investors in the gradual diffusion of information in financial markets. We show that retail investors tend to trade as contrarians after large earnings surprises, and such contrarian trading contributes to sluggish price adjustment and to momentum. Retail traders are particularly active for small loser stocks. As a robustness check, we double sort stocks in quintiles based on momentum and the strength of retail contrarian trading, and find that the momentum phenomenon arises only in the 4th and 5th quintile of contrarian trading intensity. We further investigate the timing and the horizon of the traders, the role of segmentation in stock ownership, and the role of attention and browsing behavior in generating contrarian trading. Alternative hypotheses, such as the disposition effect, and stale limit orders, do not explain the phenomenon.

**Abstract:** A recent literature has documented large real effects of trade policy uncertainty (TPU) on trade, employment, and investment, but there is little evidence that investors are compensated for bearing such risk. To quantify the risk premium associated with TPU, we exploit quasi-experimental variation in exposure to TPU arising from Congressional votes to revoke China's preferential tariff treatment between 1990 and 2001. A long-short portfolio designed to isolate exposure to TPU earns a risk-adjusted return of 3.6-6.2% per year. This effect is larger in sectors less protected from globalization, and more reliant on inputs from China. Industries more exposed to trade policy uncertainty also had a larger drop in stock prices when the uncertainty began, and more volatile returns around key policy dates. Our results are not explained by the effects of policy uncertainty on expected cash-flows, investors' forecast errors, and import competition from China.

**Abstract:** No previous infectious disease outbreak, including the Spanish Flu, has impacted the stock market as forcefully as the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, previous pandemics left only mild traces on the U.S. stock market. We use text-based methods to develop these points with respect to large daily stock market moves back to 1900 and with respect to overall stock market volatility back to 1985. We also evaluate potential explanations for the unprecedented stock market reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence we amass suggests that government restrictions on commercial activity and voluntary social distancing, operating with powerful effects in a service-oriented economy, are the main reasons the U.S. stock market reacted so much more forcefully to COVID-19 than to previous pandemics in 1918-19, 1957-58 and 1968.

**Abstract:** We find that money managers could reduce portfolio risk by incorporating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria into their investment process. ESG-related issues can cause sudden regulatory changes and shifts in consumer tastes, resulting in large asset price swings which leave investors limited time to react. By incorporating ESG criteria in their investment strategy, money managers can tilt their holdings towards firms which are well prepared to deal with these changes, thereby managing exposure to these rare but potentially large risks.
